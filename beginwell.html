                <h4>Why is it so difficult to find consise and clear information about a therapist?</h4>
                <p>The process for finding a therapist often requires multiple
                methods of searching, dealing with an overload of information,
                and takes too much time. It can becomes a deterrant for those
                seeking mental health services, myself included.</p>

            <div class="section-title-bar"></div>
            <p class="p-alt">To begin solving the problem of finding a therapist, I first
              had to discover if the difficulty of finding a therapist was a
              problem that exists among young adults, and collect information
              from potential users. Though it was easy to relate to my personal
              experiences, I am not every user and I needed to keep an unbiased
              focus throughout the project.</p>

            <h6>01.01 / USER SURVEY</h6>
            <div class="sub-section-title-bar"></div>
            <p>I conducted a survey with 33 participants with the goals to discover
              if young adults are seeking therapists now or will in the future, their
              current process to access information, their frustrations, if any, in
              the process, and their decision making process for contacting a therapist.</p>
            <aside class="section-app">
                <p>I realized at this point, I only had an idea what would be
                  important to me as a user. I needed the survey to uncover
                  what potential solutions users needed the most before working
                  on any possible designs.</p>

                    <p class="stats-content stats-right">54% did not know where
                        to start.</p>
                    <p>Frustrations ranged from starting the process to tracking
                        down information.</p>

                        is important.</p>
                    <p>Trusting a therapist starts with learning more about the therapist
                        and the services they offer.</p>

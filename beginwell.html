            <p>The process for finding a therapist often requires multiple
                methods of searching, dealing with an overload of information,
                and takes too much time. It can become a deterrant for those
                seeking mental health services, myself included.</p>

            <p>To begin solving the problem of finding a therapist, I first
              had to discover if the difficulty of finding a therapist was a
              problem that exists among young adults, and collect information
              from potential users. Though it was easy to relate to my personal
              experiences, I am not every user and I needed to keep an unbiased
              focus throughout the project.</p>

                <p>I conducted a survey with 33 participants with the goals to discover

                  current process to access information, their frustrations, if any, in

            <p>With survey results in hand, I conducted follow up interviews with
              3 participants to learn more about their experiences. As a result, the

            <aside>
                <p>Even though I prepared a list of questions, I learned the interviews

                  quotes directly from the conversations to use as part of the personas. </br>
                  Being able to refer back to the personas while making later design
                  decisions was a big takeaway for me. Spending some time getting to know

              <p>Expanding my research to non-related sites and focusing on

                <p>Conducting user tests on the wireframes was a good way to
                  gauge the functionality of the design, without focusing on
                  the visual design. The mix of online UserTests and in-person
                  testing revealed some lapses in the layout design. The CTA
                  buttons were getting lost on the search results page, which
                  resulted in another iteration to clarify the CTA hierarchy.</p>

                      revealed the confusion on the search results page.</p>

              <p>With a grasp on the functionality of the site in
                place, tackling the visual identity of the site started with
                finding a name. Using a similar process of research and prototyping
                iterations helped me wrap my head around creating BeginWell’s brand,
                which then informed the visual design for the high-fidelity mockups.</p>

                  <p>Using visual exercises and creating a mind map helped me narrow
                    down my ideas for a name that captured the idea of starting
                    something new and beginning a new mental health journey. Through this process,
                    I started zeroing on words like "begin", "journey", "heal", and "well". After some more rounds of brainstorming,
                    BeginWell was finalized as the name and used in logo sketches.</p>

                      <p>While creating a moodboard and focusing on emotional patterns, I was drawn to words like
                        “refresh” and “exhale”, and images of flags waving. The idea of flags representing the start of something new, while also flying free on their own captured the emotions I wanted to tie into BeginWell's brand.</p>

              <div class="sub-section-content">
                  <p>The final logo was created with hand-drawn inspired flags
                    that also resemble the letters B and W. The hand-drawn inspiration
                    also reflects the idea that like ourselves, not everything
                    needs to be “perfect”. Using the typeface Paytone One evoked
                    a similar sense of motion as the flags, while offering
                    a uniqueness that I thought the wordmark needed. Muli was
                    chosen as the typeface for all body content, as it offered
                    the range of styles needed to created hierarchy, and played
                    to similar curves and x-height as Paytone One.</p>

                  <p>The color palette was influenced by a photo of flags, with
                    a teal-blue chosen as the primary brand color to capture the
                    sense of trustworthiness. The purple call to action offered
                    a strong contrast to different shades of the primary color,
                    while the yellow created an accent of light symbolic to the
                    process of finding a therapist.</p>

                from both tests informed the final clickable prototype and provided
                a baseline for future development.</p>

                    In order to decide which direction to go in, I created an A/B

                    and White homepage. Even though this wasn’t initially helpful,
                    the comments provided by testers proved to be the information
                    I needed. Analyzing them showed that users liked the “brightness”
                    the Blue&frasl;Yellow theme offered, but didn’t like the large
                    sections of yellow. While the Blue/Black and White theme was
                    a bit dark, but seemed more polish. With that in mind, I blended the two themes and created the final homepage.</p>

                    clickable prototype. The focus on the prototype testing was
                    to observe users completing a series of tasks to highlight
                    any areas of confusion or actions that were not intuitive
                    to complete. Overall, the testing was very positive and all
                    6 users were able to complete the tasks and commented on the
                    easy-to-use functions, like the filter bar.</br>
                    The testing also reinforced the user stories for future development.
                    Multiple testers commented on booking an appointment with a
                    therapist and that they would like to see specific dates and
                    times avialable within the site. Researching and designing an
                    appointment system will be an interesting challenge in the future.</p>

                      <p>The testing also highlighted an oversight on my part.

                        therapist was accepting new patients, which was originally
                        a high priority user story. This was a great reminder to
                        review and re-review the user stories throughout the
                        design process - it’s easy for something to slip through the cracks.</p>

              <h3>06. Final Thoughts</h3>
              <div class="section-title-bar"></div>
              <p>This project was personal and important to me, not only as a
                designer but because of the impact it could have on how we look
                and interact with mental health services. Mental health is a complex
                topic, but taking the time to get to know potential users, not
                just basing decisions on my experience, was crucial in developing
                a solution that would work for users. With a site that makes finding a therapist accessible and easy to do, it could mean one more person could find the services they need to get help without feeling the stress of the process or the stigma that still exists surrounding mental health.</p>

                <p>Challenging myself to create
                and recreate wireframes helped me expand my understanding of how
                design decisions impact usability and evaluating designs based
                on that, rather than personal preference. In the future, I would like to expand BeginWell to include functions like booking appointments directly through the site and tackle how therapists interact with the site.

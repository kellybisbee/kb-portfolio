            <h4>Why is it so difficult to find consise and clear information about a therapist?</h4>
            <p>The process for finding a therapist often requires multiple
                methods of searching, dealing with an overload of information,
                and takes too much time. It can becomes a deterrant for those
                seeking mental health services, myself included.</p>

            <h4>Help individuals by providing all the information to find a therapist
                    in one place.</h4>
            <p>BeginWell is a website focused on the first step of finding a
                local therapist for individuals looking for the first time or

                BeginWell provides a process for finding a therapist that is familiar to

            <div class="section-title-bar"></div>
            <p class="p-alt">To begin solving the problem of finding a therapist, I first
              had to discover if the difficulty of finding a therapist was a
              problem that exists among young adults, and collect information
              from potential users. Though it was easy to relate to my personal
              experiences, I am not every user and I needed to keep an unbiased
              focus throughout the project.</p>

            <div class="sub-section-content">
                <p>I conducted a survey with 33 participants with the goals to discover
                  if young adults are seeking therapists now or will in the future, their
                  current process to access information, their frustrations, if any, in
                  the process, and their decision making process for contacting a therapist.</p>
                <aside>
                    <p>I realized at this point, I only had an idea what would be
                      important to me as a user. I needed the survey to uncover
                      what potential solutions users needed the most before working
                      on any possible designs.</p>

                        to start.</p>
                <p>Frustrations ranged from starting the process to tracking
                        down information.</p>

                <p class="stats stats-right">For 97%, type of therapy
                        is important.</p>
                <p>Trusting a therapist starts with learning more about the therapist
                        and the services they offer.</p>

        <h6>01.02 / User Personas</h6>
        <div class="sub-section-title-bar"></div>
        <div class="sub-section-content">
            <p>With survey results in hand, I conducted follow up interviews with
              3 participants to learn more about their experiences. As a result, the
              personas created representational users that would inform my design
              decisions later in the process.</p>
            <aside>
                <p>Even though I prepared a list of questions, I learned the interviews
                  were more successful as casual conversations. I was able to pull
                  quotes directly from the conversations to use as part of the personas. </br>
                  Being able to refer back to the personas while making later design
                  decisions was a big takeaway for me. Spending some time getting to know
                  my personas helped create a narrative for each that served as a
                  guiding baseline.</p>

          <p>Hey there, I’m Kelly - a designer eager to join a rad team. After starting my career in the travel industry and coordinating group travel arrangements, I jumped head first into design after realizing I could be the one solving the problems that continued to bug me. There are only so many times you can sort paper train tickets by hand or track down lost luggage around the world before you start thinking that there could be other ways to do things.</p>

          <p>After four years in the travel industry, my curiosity and empathy for people affected by these problems pushed me in a new direction. To start my new trip into the UX world, I completed Bloc’s nine-month design mentorship. While focusing on UX and UI design and the foundations of frontend development, I developed the tools to be an advocate for the user with intuitive and practical solutions. With these tools, I'm ready to tackle real world problems and reduce the number of headaches we all experience - including (but definitely not limited to) paper train tickets.</p>

          <p>When I’m not behind my laptop, I am trying to push myself into new experiences as much as possible. Don’t get me wrong, I will gladly Netflix-binge Stranger Things (for the third time...), but I’m a big believer in learning from experiences and try to carry what I learn into my work. And sometimes those new experiences lead you into a disco phone booth in Berlin or on a midnight adventure to Yellowstone. Part of the excitement is not always knowing where you’ll end up.</p>

          <p>I’m currently looking to join a design team that loves mentorship and is looking for someone who can teach everyone the importance of Barbra Streisand. East Coast... West Coast... anywhere in between - let’s see how we can work together!</p>

        <div>
          <p>Hey there, I’m Kelly - a designer eager to join a rad team. After starting my career in the travel industry, I jumped head first into design after realizing I could be the one helping to solve the problems that bugged me on the regular. My curiosity and advocacy for the user has guided me through my transition into design, and it’s been an exciting trip so far. For the past nine months, I have been completing Bloc’s Design mentorship, focusing on UX and UI design and the foundations of frontend development.<br/>When I’m not behind my laptop, I am trying to push myself into new experiences as much as possible. Don’t get me wrong, I will gladly Netflix-binge Stranger Things (for the third time...), but I’m a big believer in learning from experiences and try to carry what I learn into my work. And sometimes those new experiences lead you into a disco phone booth in Berlin or on a midnight adventure to Yellowstone. Part of the excitement is not always knowing where you’ll end up.<br/>I’m currently looking to join a design team that loves mentorship and is looking for someone that can teach everyone the importance of Barbra Streisand. East Coast... West Coast... anywhere in between - let’s see how we can work together!
